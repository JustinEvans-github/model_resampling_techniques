# Resampling Techniques
Resampling techniques to use on modeling train/test/validation data splits.  

### [Resample Size](resample_size.ipynb)
Basic resampling of training data and the effect of increasing training dataset size.

### [Resampling Methods](resampling_methods.ipynb)
Investigate how to use large data source for building training datasets without drastically increasing model training/tuning times.

A comparison between:
1. All of the data
2. Balanced data
3. Randomly adding in data
4. Adding in data by lowest class precision * (main test)
